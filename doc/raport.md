# Description
The app is a simple, very flawed and badly designed app for signing up to a 'by invite only' party. Attending guests can sign in with a unique username, their name, phone number and email address, and to submit their registration they need to give the password they have been given with the invite. After that the guest can view their own sign up if they wish to. Admins are (supposedly) required to sign in on the log in page with a username and a password. Admin users can view all guests and delete registrations.

For trying the app, the user credentials for guest and admin are
for guest: password: ```w3Lc0M32p4rTy!```
for admin: username: ```admin```, password: ```a4tG2ivnk70q9```
